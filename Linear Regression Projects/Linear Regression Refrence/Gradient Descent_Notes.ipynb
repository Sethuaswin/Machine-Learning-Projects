    "**For linear regression we use a cost function known as the mean squared error or MSE.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start implementing the cost function for linear regression, which is also known as MSE (Mean Squared Error). MSE computes the 'goodness of fit' for a fitted line. The cost function takes two values, i.e.$(m,c)$, where $m$ is the coefficient and $c$ s the intercept. The cost function iterates through each point in the given dataset and then computes the sum of the square distance between each point and the line.\n",

    "$$J(m,c) = \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{N}\\big(y_{i} - (mx_{i}+c)\\big)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will apply partial derivative with respect to m and c and will equate it to zero to find the least value of m and c for which our cost function get the lowest value as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to minimise the cost function, which will result in lower error values. If we minimise the cost function, we will get the best fit line to our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is an optimisation algorithm used to find the values of the parameters (coefficients) of a function (f) that minimises a cost function. To run gradient descent on the error function above, you first need to compute its gradient. To calculate it, you will need to differentiate your error function. Since the function is defined by two parameters (m and c), you need to compute a partial derivative for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial m} = 2 \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{N}\\big(y_{i} - (mx_{i}+c)\\big) \\big(-x_{i}\\big)$$\n",

Now, if you simply sum up the errors and multiply by half (1/2), we get the total error of $\\frac{1}{2m} \\sum \\big(h_{\\theta}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\\big)^2$, but if you divide it by the number of summands, you would get the average error per data point of $\\frac{1}{2m} \\sum \\big(h_{\\theta}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\\big)^2$ The reason for dividing the error by half (1/2) is to get a nice interpretation for minimising (half) the average error per data point."
